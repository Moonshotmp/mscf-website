                <article class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed space-y-6">

                    <figure class="my-10 -mx-4 md:-mx-8">
                        <img src="/images/blog-pregnancy-barbell.webp" alt="Pregnant woman loading a barbell plate at a CrossFit gym" class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg" width="1200" height="800" loading="eager">
                    </figure>

                    <p>If you're pregnant and wondering whether you should still be working out — let alone touching a barbell — you're not alone. There's a lot of noise out there. Outdated advice. Well-meaning but vague suggestions to "just take it easy." Maybe even pressure to stop altogether.</p>

                    <p>Here's the truth: training during pregnancy isn't just safe — when done with proper coaching, it's one of the most beneficial things you can do for your body, your baby, and your recovery.</p>

                    <p>Research consistently supports that strength training during pregnancy can:</p>

                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-4">
                        <li>Reduce the risk of gestational diabetes and preeclampsia</li>
                        <li>Decrease low back and pelvic pain</li>
                        <li>Improve labor and delivery outcomes (shorter labor, lower C-section rates)</li>
                        <li>Support healthy weight management</li>
                        <li>Boost mood and reduce anxiety/depression symptoms</li>
                        <li>Build a stronger foundation for postpartum recovery</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The key isn't whether you train. It's <strong class="text-brand-light">how you train</strong> — and who's guiding you.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-title text-2xl md:text-3xl mt-12 mb-4">What Changes (and What Doesn't)</h2>

                    <p>Pregnancy isn't an injury. But it is a significant physiological event that changes your body week by week. Hormone shifts (particularly relaxin) affect joint stability. Your center of gravity shifts. Intra-abdominal pressure changes as your belly grows. Breathing mechanics adapt.</p>

                    <p>A good prenatal training approach accounts for all of this. At <a href="/" class="text-moonlight-blue font-semibold hover:underline">Moonshot CrossFit</a>, that means:</p>

                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-4">
                        <li>Scaling and substituting movements as your pregnancy progresses — not eliminating training</li>
                        <li>Prioritizing breathing and core pressure management over raw intensity</li>
                        <li>Adjusting barbell and gymnastics movements to accommodate your changing body</li>
                        <li>Monitoring exertion and recovery with more intention than usual</li>
                        <li>Keeping you strong in the movement patterns that matter most: squatting, hinging, pressing, pulling, carrying</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>You won't get a generic "prenatal workout" pulled off the internet. You'll get real coaching from someone who understands how to modify a CrossFit class in real time for a pregnant athlete.</p>

                            <p>She's also a mom of three — so she's not coaching from theory. She's coached through it.

                            <p>Whether you're in your first trimester and feeling great, or deep into your third and just trying to move well, Sarah will meet you where you are with real modifications, clear feedback, and zero judgment.</p>

                    <p>Pregnancy is one of the most demanding physical experiences your body will go through. Training for it makes sense.</p>

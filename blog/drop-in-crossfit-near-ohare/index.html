                    <p>If you're flying through O'Hare and the thought of missing a workout makes you twitchy, we get it. Hotel gyms are depressing. A treadmill and two rusty dumbbells aren't going to cut it. You want a real workout, with a barbell, a pull-up bar, and people who actually care about the hour they're spending in the gym.</p>

                    <p>Good news: <a href="/" class="text-brand-gold hover:underline">Moonshot CrossFit</a> is less than 10 minutes from O'Hare International Airport, and we welcome drop-ins. Here's everything you need to know.</p>

                    <p>We run classes throughout the day, but here are the times that tend to work best for business travelers and people passing through:</p>

                    <div class="card p-6 rounded-lg my-6 space-y-4">
                        <div class="flex items-start gap-4">

                                <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Early bird class.</strong> Perfect if you want to get a workout in before your morning meetings or an early flight. You'll be done by 6:30am and showered by 7. Plenty of time.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                                <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Second morning class.</strong> If 5:30 is a bridge too far after a late flight, this one still gets you moving before the workday.</p>

                        </div>

                    <p>We run additional classes throughout the week as well. Check the full schedule on our site or just reach out and we'll point you to the best option for your timing.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4" style="font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;">What to Expect as a Drop-In</h2>

                    <p>If you've done CrossFit before, you'll feel right at home. If you haven't, don't worry — our coaches scale every workout, and nobody's going to throw you into the deep end without a lifeline.</p>

                    <p>Here's the general flow:</p>

                    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-3 text-gray-300">
                        <li><strong>Show up 10-15 minutes early.</strong> This gives you time to sign a waiver, meet your coach, and get oriented. We'll ask about your experience level and any injuries.</li>
                        <li><strong>Warm-up together.</strong> Every class starts with a group warm-up led by the coach. This gets your body ready and lets you get a feel for the space.</li>
                        <li><strong>Skill or strength portion.</strong> Most classes have a strength or skill component before the conditioning piece. Your coach will help you pick appropriate weights and scaling.</li>
                        <li><strong>The workout (WOD).</strong> This is the main event — usually 8-20 minutes of work. Your coach will explain the workout, offer scaling options, and keep an eye on your movement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cool down and hang out.</strong> Stretch, chat, grab some water. CrossFitters are friendly people, especially to visitors. You'll probably get asked where you're from and where your home gym is.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>The vibe is welcoming but not soft. We push people here. That's why they come. But "push" doesn't mean reckless — it means your coach knows when to encourage you and when to pull you back. Every workout is scalable, and we'd rather you move well at a lighter weight than sloppy at a heavy one.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4" style="font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;">How to Get Here from O'Hare</h2>

                    <p>It's a straight shot. From the airport, you'll head south on Mannheim Road or hop on I-90 East and take the Cumberland exit. Either way, you're looking at about 8-10 minutes depending on traffic. Plug <strong>542 Busse Hwy, Park Ridge, IL</strong> into your GPS and it'll take you right to the door.</p>

                    <p>We're close to pretty much anywhere you'd be staying in the O'Hare corridor:</p>

                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-300">
                        <li><strong>Rosemont</strong> — 5-8 minutes away. If you're near the convention center or the entertainment district, we're practically next door.</li>
                        <li><strong>Des Plaines</strong> — 5-10 minutes. Several hotels along Mannheim and Touhy are a quick drive.</li>
                        <li><strong>Niles</strong> — about 10 minutes east. Easy access via Touhy or Dempster.</li>
                        <li><strong>Edison Park</strong> — the Chicago neighborhood right next to Park Ridge. Some of our members live there. 5 minutes tops.</li>
                        <li><strong>Elk Grove Village / Schiller Park</strong> — 10-15 minutes. Lots of corporate hotels in this corridor.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4" style="font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;">What If I'm Not a CrossFitter?</h2>

                    <p>That's fine. If you're someone who just wants a good workout while you're in town and you've never done CrossFit, you're still welcome to drop in. Just let us know ahead of time so we can pair you with the right class and give you a little extra coaching attention.</p>

                    <p>We also offer <a href="/intro/" class="text-brand-gold hover:underline">free intros</a> if you want to sit down with a coach one-on-one first. That's usually more relevant for locals thinking about joining, but if you're curious about CrossFit and want a low-pressure introduction, it's there.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4" style="font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;">A Few Things That Make Moonshot Different</h2>

                    <p>You've probably dropped in at a few gyms around the country. Here's what you'll notice about Moonshot:</p>

                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-300">
                        <li><strong>Clean facility.</strong> We take care of our space. Equipment is maintained. Floors are clean. Bathrooms are stocked. The basics matter.</li>
                        <li><strong>Good coaching.</strong> Our coaches actually coach. They're not just running a timer — they're watching your movement and giving you cues.</li>
                        <li><strong>Real community.</strong> People say hi. They introduce themselves. It's not cliquey. You won't feel like an outsider.</li>
                        <li><strong>More than a gym.</strong> We share a building with <a href="https://moonshotmp.com" class="text-brand-gold hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moonshot Medical and Performance</a>, which offers physical therapy, labs, and performance medicine. Not relevant for a drop-in necessarily, but it tells you something about the kind of place this is — we take health seriously at every level.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4" style="font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;">How to Book Your Drop-In</h2>

                    <p>Easiest way: just reach out. You can contact us through the <a href="/crossfit-near-ohare/" class="text-brand-gold hover:underline">CrossFit Near O'Hare page</a>, send us a DM on Instagram (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/moonshotcrossfit/" class="text-brand-gold hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@moonshotcrossfit</a>), or just show up 15 minutes before class and we'll get you sorted. We're laid back about it. The only thing we ask is that you sign a waiver before your first class.</p>

                    <p>If you're a regular traveler through O'Hare and you want a gym you can count on every trip, even better. Some of our drop-ins turn into recurring visitors. A few have even become members despite living in other states. CrossFit people are a particular breed, and when you find a gym that fits, you remember it.</p>

                <p>"How much does CrossFit cost?" is one of the most googled fitness questions out there. Fair question. If you're going to spend money on a gym, you deserve a straight answer before you walk through the door.</p>

                <p>The short answer: more than a big-box gym, less than a personal trainer. The real answer requires a bit of context -- because what you're paying for at a CrossFit gym is fundamentally different from what you're paying for at a $30/month commercial gym. And once you understand what's actually included, the price makes a lot more sense.</p>

                <p>Here's the honest breakdown.</p>

                <figure class="my-10 -mx-4 md:-mx-8">
                    <img src="/images/blog-coach-member-band.webp" alt="A Moonshot CrossFit coach working with a member during a training session" class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg" loading="lazy">
                </figure>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4" style="font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;">The Typical Range</h2>

                <p>Most CrossFit gyms across the country charge somewhere between $150 and $250 per month for unlimited membership. That range depends on the city, the size of the gym, and what's included. Gyms in major metros tend to be higher. Smaller towns tend to be lower. But that $150-250 window covers the vast majority of affiliates.</p>

                <p>At <a href="/" class="text-brand-gold hover:underline">Moonshot CrossFit</a> in Park Ridge, here's exactly what our pricing looks like:</p>

                <p>No hidden fees. No annual contracts you can't get out of. We're putting the numbers right here because we think you should know what something costs before you have to talk to anyone.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4" style="font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;">Why CrossFit Costs More Than a Big-Box Gym</h2>

                <p>This is the part that trips people up. A Planet Fitness membership is $10-25/month. An LA Fitness or Lifetime might run $30-80. So why is CrossFit $150-250?</p>

                <p>It's not because the gym is fancier. Most CrossFit gyms are warehouse-style spaces with rubber floors and barbells. You won't find a smoothie bar or a sauna. What you will find is a coach. Every single class.</p>

                <p>That's the difference. At a big-box gym, you're paying for access to equipment and hoping you figure out the rest. Nobody writes your program. Nobody watches your form. Nobody scales the workout to match your ability. Nobody notices if you stop coming. You get a key card and you're on your own.</p>

                <p>At a CrossFit gym, every class is coached. A certified coach writes the programming, teaches the movements, watches your form in real time, and adjusts the workout for each person in the room. That's a completely different product.</p>

                <p>Here's what goes into the cost:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Small class sizes.</strong> You're not one of 200 people in a building. You're in a class of 8-16 people where a coach knows your name.</li>
                    <li><strong>Certified coaches.</strong> Paid professionals who program, teach, and correct movement every session.</li>
                    <li><strong>Structured programming.</strong> Designed by experienced coaches, balanced across strength, conditioning, and mobility. Not a random workout pulled from Instagram.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintained equipment.</strong> Barbells, rigs, rowers, bikes -- quality gear that gets used hard and needs to be maintained and replaced.</li>
                    <li><strong>Community infrastructure.</strong> Events, challenges, onboarding, member support. The things that build the culture people actually stick with.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>When you break it down, you're not comparing apples to apples when you put CrossFit next to a $30/month gym. You're comparing coached training to unsupervised access.</p>

                <figure class="my-10 -mx-4 md:-mx-8">
                    <img src="/images/blog-group-stretching.webp" alt="Moonshot CrossFit members stretching together during a coached warm-up session" class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg" loading="lazy">
                </figure>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4" style="font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;">The Personal Trainer Math</h2>

                <p>This is where CrossFit becomes a bargain, and it's the comparison most people overlook.</p>

                <p>A personal trainer at most gyms runs $80-150 per session. Even if you only go once a week, that's $320-600 per month. Twice a week? You're looking at $640-1,200. And that's on top of whatever you're paying for the gym membership itself.</p>

                <p>At CrossFit, you get coached every single session. At Moonshot, an unlimited membership is $190/month. Most of our members train 4-5 times per week, which works out to 16-20+ coached sessions per month.</p>

                <p>Let's do the math:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Personal trainer:</strong> $320-600/month for 4 sessions (once per week)</li>
                    <li><strong>Moonshot CrossFit:</strong> $190/month for 20+ coached sessions</li>
                    <li><strong>Per-session cost at Moonshot:</strong> under $10</li>
                </ul>

                <p>That's $190 for 20+ coached sessions versus $320+ for 4 personal training sessions. The per-session coaching cost at Moonshot is under $10. You can't get 10 minutes with a personal trainer for that.</p>

                <p>Now, personal training and CrossFit aren't identical. A personal trainer gives you 100% of their attention. In a CrossFit class, you share the coach with a group. But for most people, the level of coaching and attention you get in a well-run CrossFit class is more than enough to learn the movements, stay safe, and make serious progress. And the group dynamic adds something a personal trainer can't: <a href="/blog/why-community-matters/" class="text-brand-gold hover:underline">community and accountability</a>.</p>

                <p>If you need more individualized attention, we offer <a href="/pt/" class="text-brand-gold hover:underline">1-on-1 personal training</a> at Moonshot too. But most people find that group classes give them everything they need.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4" style="font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;">What You're Actually Paying For</h2>

                <p>When you break down a CrossFit membership, here's what's inside the box:</p>

                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Programming.</strong> Designed by experienced coaches. Balanced. Periodized. Different every day. You never have to think about what to do when you walk in.</li>
                    <li><strong>Coaching.</strong> Real-time form correction, movement scaling, and guidance -- every single session. Not a YouTube video. A human being watching you move and telling you how to do it better.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accountability.</strong> People notice when you skip. Your coach knows your name. The person next to you asks where you were yesterday. That's the thing that keeps you <a href="/blog/staying-consistent-at-the-gym/" class="text-brand-gold hover:underline">showing up on the days you don't feel like it</a>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Community.</strong> The thing that keeps you coming back long after the "new gym" motivation wears off. Real relationships with people who are working toward the same thing you are.</li>
                    <li><strong>Results.</strong> Because you actually show up. Consistently. Week after week. And that's when things change.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>At Moonshot specifically, you're also paying for something most CrossFit gyms can't offer: the <a href="/ecosystem/" class="text-brand-gold hover:underline">ecosystem</a>. Our building has CrossFit, personal training, and Moonshot Medical all under one roof. If you need physical therapy, hormone optimization, or performance diagnostics, it's right here. Your coach, your trainer, and your clinician can actually talk to each other. That kind of integration doesn't exist at most gyms.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4" style="font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;">The Cost of the Gym You Don't Use</h2>

                <p>Here's the number nobody wants to think about.</p>

                <p>The average gym member in the United States uses their membership 4-5 times per month. At a $30/month gym, that works out to $6-7 per visit -- with no coaching, no programming, and no one who cares whether you come back tomorrow.</p>

                <p>CrossFit members average 12-16 visits per month. At $190/month, that's $12-16 per coached session. And if you're coming 5 days a week, you're paying under $10 per session for professional coaching in a structured environment.</p>

                <p>But here's the real kicker: the most expensive gym membership is the one you don't use. The $30/month gym you haven't been to since February is infinitely more expensive per workout than the $190/month gym you go to four times a week. You're not saving money by paying for something you don't use. You're wasting it.</p>

                <p>CrossFit gyms have dramatically higher retention and attendance rates than commercial gyms. That's not because the members are more disciplined. It's because the model is designed to keep you coming back -- through coaching, through community, through programming that never gets boring, and through people who actually notice when you're not there.</p>

                <figure class="my-10 -mx-4 md:-mx-8">
                    <img src="/images/blog-community-bowling.webp" alt="Moonshot CrossFit members enjoying a community bowling outing together" class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg" loading="lazy">
                </figure>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4" style="font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;">Is CrossFit Worth It?</h2>

                <p>Depends on what you value.</p>

                <p>If you want to train alone with headphones, do your own programming, and come and go on your own schedule, a $30/month gym is perfect for that. And if you'll actually use it consistently, it's a great deal. Seriously. No shade.</p>

                <p>But if you've tried that and it hasn't stuck -- if you've signed up, gone strong for a month, and then quietly stopped going -- then the question isn't "can I afford CrossFit?" The question is "can I afford to keep paying for something that doesn't work?"</p>

                <p>If you want coaching, community, accountability, and structured programming -- if you want someone in your corner who knows your name and cares whether you show up -- CrossFit is one of the best values in fitness. Not because it's cheap. Because it works. And the thing that works is always cheaper than the thing that doesn't.</p>

                <p>The results speak for themselves. CrossFit gyms have dramatically higher retention rates than commercial gyms. People don't stay for years at something that isn't delivering.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4" style="font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;">How to Try It Before Committing</h2>

                <p>You don't have to commit to anything to find out if CrossFit is right for you.</p>

                <p>At Moonshot, we offer a <a href="/intro/" class="text-brand-gold hover:underline">free intro session</a>. No workout required. No sales pitch. You tour the gym, meet a coach, ask every question you have, and get a feel for the place. If it feels right, great. If it doesn't, no hard feelings.</p>

                <p>If you want to try an actual class first, you can <a href="/blog/drop-in-crossfit-near-ohare/" class="text-brand-gold hover:underline">drop in</a> for $25. Show up, do the workout, see how it feels. No commitment beyond that single session.</p>

                <p>The hardest part is walking through the door. Everything after that is easier than you think.</p>

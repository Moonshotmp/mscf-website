                    <p>Here's something most people figure out eventually: the scale is a liar.</p>

                    <p>Not on purpose. It just doesn't give you enough information. You step on, you see a number, and you make a judgment call about whether your week was "good" or "bad." But that number doesn't tell you if you lost fat or muscle. It doesn't tell you if you're carrying extra water from a salty dinner. It definitely doesn't tell you if you're actually getting healthier.</p>

                    <p>That's where an InBody scan comes in. And if you've never heard of one, don't worry. It's simpler than it sounds.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4" style="font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;">So What Is an InBody Scan, Exactly?</h2>

                    <p>An <strong>InBody scan</strong> is a <strong>body composition scan</strong> that breaks down what your body is actually made of. Instead of just giving you a single number like a bathroom scale, it tells you how much of your weight is muscle, how much is fat, and how much is water — and where all of it is distributed across your body.</p>

                    <p>The device itself looks like a fancy scale with hand grips. You step on, grab the handles, and stand still for about 30 seconds. That's it. The machine sends a very low-level electrical current through your body (you can't feel it) and measures resistance in different areas. Because muscle, fat, and water all conduct electricity differently, the device can figure out what's going on under the hood with impressive accuracy.</p>

                    <p>No needles. No dunking in a water tank. No squeezing into a pod. You literally just stand there for half a minute.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4" style="font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;">What Does the Scan Actually Tell You?</h2>

                    <p>When your scan is done, you get a printout that breaks things down in a way that's genuinely useful. Here are the big ones:</p>

                    <div class="card p-6 rounded-lg my-6 space-y-4">
                        <div>
                            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white" style="font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;">Body Fat Percentage</h3>
                            <p class="text-gray-300 mt-1">This is the one most people care about, and for good reason. It's a much better measure of health and fitness than total body weight. Two people can weigh the same and look completely different depending on their body fat percentage.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white" style="font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;">Skeletal Muscle Mass</h3>
                            <p class="text-gray-300 mt-1">How much muscle you're carrying. This matters for metabolism, longevity, daily function — basically everything. More muscle means you burn more calories at rest, move better, and age better.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white" style="font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;">Segmental Lean Analysis</h3>
                            <p class="text-gray-300 mt-1">This breaks down your muscle mass by body segment — left arm, right arm, trunk, left leg, right leg. It shows you if one side is significantly weaker than the other, which is incredibly useful for rehab, injury prevention, and balanced training.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white" style="font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;">Total Body Water</h3>
                            <p class="text-gray-300 mt-1">Water distribution can tell you a lot about inflammation, recovery, and overall health. The scan measures both intracellular and extracellular water and flags if something looks off.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white" style="font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;">Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)</h3>
                            <p class="text-gray-300 mt-1">This is how many calories your body burns just existing — before exercise, before walking, before anything. Knowing this number makes nutrition planning way more precise.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4" style="font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;">Why This Beats the Scale (By a Mile)</h2>

                    <p>Let's say you start working out consistently. You eat well. You feel better. Your clothes fit differently. Then you step on the scale and it says you weigh the same as when you started.</p>

                    <p>If all you have is that scale number, you might feel defeated. But here's what actually happened: you lost 8 pounds of fat and gained 8 pounds of muscle. Your body is completely different. You're stronger, leaner, healthier. The scale just can't see it.</p>

                    <p>An InBody scan can. It shows you the full picture. And that full picture is what keeps people from making bad decisions — like crash dieting because the scale didn't move, even though their body composition is transforming.</p>

                    <p>We've seen this play out dozens of times at <a href="/intro/" class="text-brand-gold hover:underline">Moonshot CrossFit</a>. Someone comes in frustrated with their "lack of progress," we run a scan, and it turns out they've gained three pounds of muscle in the last two months. That's not a plateau. That's winning.</p>

                    <figure class="my-10 -mx-4 md:-mx-8">
                        <img src="/images/blog-spotting-bench.webp" alt="A member spotting another during a bench press at Moonshot CrossFit" class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg" loading="lazy">

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4" style="font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;">How We Use InBody Scans at Moonshot</h2>

                    <p>When you come in for a <a href="/intro/" class="text-brand-gold hover:underline">free intro at Moonshot CrossFit</a>, one of the first things we do is run an InBody scan. It's not a judgment — it's a starting point. We want to see where you are so we can figure out where you're going and how to get there.</p>

                    <p>Think of it like a GPS. You can't get directions if you don't know your starting location. The scan gives us that location. From there, we can build a plan that's actually tailored to you — not some generic program pulled off Instagram.</p>

                    <p>We also use periodic re-scans (every 4-8 weeks) to track progress over time. This keeps you honest, keeps your coach informed, and gives you real data to celebrate instead of relying on how your jeans feel (though that matters too).</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4" style="font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;">What If the Numbers Aren't Great?</h2>

                    <p>Good question. And the honest answer: it doesn't matter where you start. Nobody walks in the door at their best — that's the whole point of showing up.</p>

                    <p>The scan isn't there to make you feel bad. It's there to give you information you can actually use. High body fat percentage? Now we know, and now we can address it with specific programming and nutrition guidance. Low muscle mass? Great — that means there's a huge opportunity to build. Imbalances between your left and right sides? Our <a href="/pt/" class="text-brand-gold hover:underline">physical therapy team</a> can help with that.</p>

                    <p>You can't manage what you don't measure. That's not a cliche — it's literally how progress works. Guessing is what people do when they don't have data, and guessing is what keeps people spinning their wheels for years.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4" style="font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;">Tips for Getting an Accurate Scan</h2>

                    <p>InBody scans are very consistent, but a few things can throw them off. Here's how to get the most accurate results:</p>

                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-300">
                        <li><strong>Scan at the same time of day</strong> each time — morning is usually best.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stay hydrated normally</strong>, but don't chug a gallon of water right before.</li>
                        <li><strong>Avoid scanning right after a workout</strong> — blood flow changes can affect readings.</li>
                        <li><strong>Wear light clothing</strong> and remove shoes and socks (you'll stand barefoot on the device).</li>
                        <li><strong>Be consistent with conditions</strong> — if you scan fasted the first time, try to scan fasted each time.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4" style="font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;">The Bigger Picture</h2>

                    <p>An InBody scan is one piece of a larger puzzle. At Moonshot, we think about fitness as an ecosystem — <a href="/ecosystem/" class="text-brand-gold hover:underline">training, recovery, and optimization</a> working together. Your scan data feeds into that system. It informs your training, your <a href="/pt/" class="text-brand-gold hover:underline">rehab if you need it</a>, and even your <a href="https://moonshotmp.com" class="text-brand-gold hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">medical and performance work</a> if you want to go deeper with labs and hormone optimization.</p>

                    <p>That's what separates real progress from just "going to the gym." Data. Direction. Accountability. And it all starts with knowing where you stand — literally.</p>

Our program is extremely effective for fat loss and building lean muscle—the combination that creates a 'toned' look. By combining strength training with high-intensity conditioning, you'll turn your body into a fat-burning machine." },
                    { q: "How long until I see results from CrossFit?", a: "You’ll *feel* better within your first couple of weeks—more energy, better sleep. Most members start seeing visible changes in their body composition and strength within 4-6 weeks of consistent training (3-4 times per week) and sensible nutrition." },
                    { q: "Can I do CrossFit to lose belly fat?", a: "While you can't spot-reduce fat from one area, CrossFit is fantastic for reducing overall body fat, including from the belly. Our full-body workouts and focus on core strength, combined with good nutrition, are the most effective way to achieve this." }

                questions: [
                    { q: "Will CrossFit make me look bulky?", a: "No — most women won’t get bulky from CrossFit. Our training builds lean, toned muscle and burns fat, helping you feel stronger and more athletic without adding unwanted size. “Bulk” usually comes from a combination of high-volume training and overeating — not functional fitness." },
                    { q: "What if I want to tone up but not gain too much muscle?", a: "That’s exactly what CrossFit is designed for. You’ll develop muscle definition and burn fat, not size up. The way your body changes depends largely on your nutrition, especially your calorie intake and macronutrient balance. We have two in-house nutrition coaches who can help you tailor your diet to your goals.<br><br>📩 Want help with your nutrition plan? Email us at <a href='mailto:info@moonshotcrossfit.com' class='text-sky-400 hover:underline'>info@moonshotcrossfit.com</a> and we’ll connect you with one of our coaches." },
                    { q: "Do women really need to lift weights?", a: "Absolutely. Lifting weights helps you improve strength, metabolism, and body composition — without making you look masculine. It’s one of the most effective ways to get a fit, athletic look. Plus, muscle helps burn more calories at rest and improves long-term health." },
                    { q: "How can I get lean and toned through CrossFit?", a: "By combining consistent training with smart nutrition. CrossFit workouts build muscle and boost your metabolism, but to really see definition, your food choices matter. That’s why we offer nutrition coaching in-house — to help you manage calories, protein, and carbs in a way that supports your ideal body.<br><br>📧 Reach out at <a href='mailto:info@moonshotcrossfit.com' class='text-sky-400 hover:underline'>info@moonshotcrossfit.com</a> if you’d like to speak with a coach about customizing your plan." }

                    { q: "What CrossFit exercises build bigger arms?", a: "Pull-ups, dips, cleans, jerks, and curls in our accessory work all contribute. We mix functional strength with targeted volume to grow arms." },

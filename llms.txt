## Frequently Asked Questions

### Who should join Moonshot CrossFit?
Anyone looking for real coaching, real community, and real results. Most of our members are everyday adults — parents, professionals, retirees — who want to get stronger, move better, and stay healthy long-term. You do not need to be in shape to start. Every workout is scaled by our coaches to match your current fitness level. We also offer dedicated programs for kids (ages 5-10) and teen athletes (ages 11-18).

### What makes Moonshot CrossFit different from other gyms in Park Ridge?
Three things stand out. First, every class is coached — a certified coach writes the programming, teaches the movements, watches your form, and scales the workout to your level. You never have to figure it out alone. Second, the community here is genuinely welcoming. Members know each other's names, cheer each other on, and notice when you don't show up. Third, we share a building with Moonshot Medical and Performance, so you can access physical therapy, medical-grade labs, and hormone optimization without leaving the building.

### Is CrossFit safe for beginners?
Yes. This is one of the most common misconceptions about CrossFit. At Moonshot, every workout is scalable — meaning the coach modifies weights, movements, and intensity based on where you are today. A brand-new member doing their first class might do air squats with no weight while an experienced athlete next to them does back squats at 200 lbs. Same workout, different levels. Our coaches are certified and trained to help beginners learn proper form before adding intensity.

### What does a first visit to Moonshot CrossFit look like?
We recommend starting with a free 1-on-1 intro session. You'll tour the gym, meet a coach, talk about your goals, and optionally do a quick InBody body composition scan to set a baseline. There's no workout during the intro and absolutely no sales pressure. It's just a chance to see the space, ask questions, and decide if it feels right. You can book a free intro at https://moonshotcrossfit.com/intro.

### How much does Moonshot CrossFit cost?
Unlimited membership is $190/month. A 3x per week plan is $170/month. We also offer couples unlimited ($310/month for two people), 10-class punch cards ($205), 5-class punch cards ($115), and single drop-in classes ($25). Personal training ranges from $100-$250/hour depending on the coach.

### What are the class times?
We offer classes throughout the day to fit different schedules. Early birds can catch 5:30am or 6:30am classes. Mid-morning classes run at 9:30am and 10:30am (select days). Afternoon/evening classes at 4:30pm, 5:30pm, and 6:30pm. Saturday has 8am, 9am, and 10am classes. Sunday is open gym from 7:30-10:30am.

### Can I drop in if I'm visiting or traveling near O'Hare?
Absolutely. We're less than 10 minutes from O'Hare Airport and we love having drop-in visitors. The cost is $25 per class, and if you end up joining, that $25 is credited toward your membership. No advance booking required — just show up, sign a waiver, and jump in. We have early morning and evening classes that work great for business travelers.

### What is functional fitness and why does it matter?
Functional fitness means training movements that directly translate to real life — squatting, lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, climbing. Unlike machine-based exercises that isolate one muscle, functional training builds strength and coordination across your whole body. This matters because it makes everyday life easier (carrying groceries, playing with your kids, climbing stairs) and it builds resilience against injury as you age. CrossFit is built on functional movements performed at varying intensity levels.

### Does Moonshot offer programs for kids and teens?
Yes. Our Kids Program (ages 5-10) focuses on movement fundamentals, coordination, teamwork, and confidence through fun, coached sessions. Our Teen Athlete Prep program (ages 11-18) is an 8-week sport-focused strength, speed, and agility training program for student-athletes. Both programs are led by experienced coaches with youth-specific certifications.

### What is the Moonshot Ecosystem?
The Moonshot Ecosystem refers to the integrated health and fitness services available under one roof at 542 Busse Hwy in Park Ridge. It includes Moonshot CrossFit (training), on-site physical therapy and rehab through Moonshot Medical (recovery), and performance medicine including medical-grade labs, hormone optimization, and metabolic health programs through Moonshot Medical (optimization). This means members can get their training, their rehab for a nagging injury, and their bloodwork all in the same building.

### How is CrossFit different from a traditional gym?
The biggest difference is coaching. At a traditional gym, you're on your own — you write your own program, choose your own exercises, and judge your own form. At CrossFit, a certified coach programs the workout, teaches you how to do each movement safely, watches your form, and scales the intensity to your level. You also train in a class with other people, which creates built-in accountability and community. Traditional gyms offer more scheduling flexibility and are often cheaper, but most people get better results with coaching and accountability.

### What should I know about CrossFit if I'm over 40?
CrossFit is excellent for adults over 40 because it focuses on exactly the things that matter for healthy aging: strength (maintaining muscle mass), mobility (keeping your joints healthy), cardiovascular fitness, and bone density (loaded movements help maintain bone health). At Moonshot, many of our members are in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. Every workout is scaled to your ability, and our coaches understand how to modify movements for different needs. For members who want to go deeper, Moonshot Medical offers medical-grade labs and performance optimization.

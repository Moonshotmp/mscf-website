      If you train consistently but your energy, recovery, or body composition feels “stuck,” the next step is often better data — not more intensity.
      This guide explains when labs can be useful, what to look at first, and how to use results intelligently.

      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold moonlight-blue mb-3">When labs are worth considering</h2>
      <ul class="text-gray-300 space-y-2">
        <li>• Sleep is poor or you wake up unrefreshed most days</li>
        <li>• Recovery feels slower than it used to</li>
        <li>• Weight or body composition stalls despite consistent training + nutrition</li>
        <li>• Mood, motivation, or focus feels off</li>
        <li>• You’re doing “everything right” but don’t feel like yourself</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm mt-4">This is education, not medical advice. Always work with a licensed provider for diagnosis/treatment.</p>

      You don’t need 100 markers to get signal. Start with a focused panel and expand only if something is abnormal or symptoms persist.
